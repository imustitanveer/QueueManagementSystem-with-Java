# Queue Management System

This Java program implements a simple queue management system. It allows users to enqueue elements, dequeue elements, and display the current state of the queue.

## Features
- **Enqueue:** Add an element to the end of the queue.
- **Dequeue:** Remove an element from the front of the queue.
- **Display Queue:** View the elements currently in the queue.
- **Exit:** Terminate the program.

## How to Use
1. Compile the Java file `QueueManagementSystem.java`.
2. Run the compiled Java class `QueueManagementSystem`.
3. Follow the on-screen menu instructions to perform queue operations.

## Implementation Details
- The program utilizes a LinkedList to implement the queue data structure.
- LinkedList provides efficient insertion and deletion operations at both ends of the list, making it suitable for queue operations.
- It supports constant-time enqueue and dequeue operations, ensuring optimal performance.

## Note
LinkedList implementation facilitates queue operations efficiently as it supports constant-time insertion and deletion at both ends (front and back), which aligns with enqueue and dequeue operations of a queue. This is advantageous over ArrayList, especially for frequent insertions and deletions, as it avoids the need for array resizing and shifting, resulting in better performance and memory management.
